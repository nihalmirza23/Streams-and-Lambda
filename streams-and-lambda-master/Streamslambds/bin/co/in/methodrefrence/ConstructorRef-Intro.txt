*** Method refrence *****

* This is used to simplify the implementation of the functional interfaces
* It is shortcut for the lambda expressions
* It is used to refer a method in a class

Syntax:
	ClassName :: Instance-Method-Name
	ClassName :: static-Method-Name
	Instance :: Method-Name
	
Where we can use method reference??
* Lambda expressions directly referring to the methods

Using Lambda:
	Function<String, String > f1 = (string) -> string.toUpperCase();

Using Method reference
	Function<String, String > f1 = String::toUpperCase;
	
	
	
Where Method reference is not applicable?
	Predicate<Integer> p = (i)-> i%2==0;
	
	here we are writing our own logic and not pointing to any method directly
	if we want to use the method reference then we need to create a method to do so.
